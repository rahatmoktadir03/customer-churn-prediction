    Here are summary statistics for non-churned customers:
    {df[df['Exited'] == 0].describe()}

- If the customer has over 40% risk of churning , (generate a 3-sentence explanation of why they are at the risk of churning)
else
- If the customer has less than 40% risk of churning ,( generate a 3-sentence explanation of why they may not be at risk of churning)
-your explanation sh based on the customer's profile without referencing specific numbers or comparisons to data sets.
**Important:** Do not mention the probability of churning, the machine learning model, any specific model outputs, or do not provide any summary statistics.
